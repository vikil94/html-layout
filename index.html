    <h2>UX in the Age of Personalization</h2>
        <h3>by <a href="https://alistapart.com/author/colineagan">Colin Eagan</a></h3>

          <p>If you listened to episode 180 of The Big Web Show, you heard two key themes: 1) personalization is now woven into much of the fabric of our digital technology, and 2) designers need to be much more involved in its creation and deployment. In my previous article we took a broad look at the first topic: the practice of harvesting user data to personalize web content, including the rewards (this website gets me!) and risks (creepy!). In this piece, we will take a more detailed look at the UX practitioner’s emerging role in personalization design: from influencing technology selection, to data modeling, to page-level implementation. And it’s high time we did.</p>

        <p>When we think about it, our whole industry depends on our faith in a handful of “black boxes” few of us fully understand: browsers. We hand over our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cross our fingers, and hope they render the experience we have in our heads. But knowing how they work can really get you out of a jam when things go wrong. That’s why we’ve assembled a handful of incredibly knowledgeable authors to take us under the hood in this four-part series. Join us on this trip across the web, into the often foggy valley between code and experience.</p>
